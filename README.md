## Rural Land Valuation:

Rural land is a notoriously difficult asset to price.  The relatively low transaction volume coupled with nebulous land features create a market with few similarly comparable properties. This project focused on quantifying land features in order to improve accuracy for investment decisions.

### Process:

In order to control for geographic and legislative variation, such as topography, climate, and taxes, the sample set was chosen from a region of a contiguous counties comprising the Blacksland North Texas Region.  Data was sourced from landoftexas.com property listings and processed using Beautiful Soup and Selenium.  Only previously sold properties were included so that all data provides an accurate representation of market value.

### Assumptions & Error Sources:



* Consistent variation of sale / listing price ratio
* Topography feature mentions proportional to reality
* Mineral right ownership claims accurate
