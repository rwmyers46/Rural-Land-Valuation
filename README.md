## Rural Land Valuation:

Rural land is a notoriously difficult asset to price.  The relatively low transaction volume coupled with nebulous land features create a market with few similarly comparable properties. This project is an attempt to quantify land features in order to improve accuracy for investment decisions.

In order to control for legislative factors, such as taxes and water rights, the sample set was chosen from a region of counties in Texas sharing similar policies: Blacksland North Texas Region. Data was sourced from landoftexas.com property listings.

### Assumptions & Error Sources:

* Consistent variation of sale / listing price ratio
* Topography feature mentions proportional to reality
* Mineral right ownership claims accurate
